1.	What the Devices Do: o	AD9850: This chip creates a digital square wave signal. Think of it like a very accurate tone generator that can change its tone (frequency) when you tell it to. o	Pico 2: This microcontroller board can read analog signals using its built-in ADC (analog-to-digital converter). It “listens” to the voltage levels at one of its pins (GP28 in your case). 2.	How the Signal Travels: o	The AD9850 sends out a square wave, which means the voltage rapidly switches between high and low. o	This square wave goes into a circuit made of resistors, an inductor, and a capacitor (an RLC circuit). The RLC circuit acts like a filter, and its behavior (how it passes or blocks parts of the signal) changes if you touch it because your finger adds a bit of extra capacitance. 3.	Measuring the Change: o	The point where the RLC circuit “filters” the signal is connected to the Pico 2’s ADC. When you touch the sensor, the extra capacitance changes the voltage at this point. o	The Pico 2 reads this change in voltage and can decide that a touch has occurred. 4.	Additional Control: o	There’s also a connection from the Pico 2 (through a GPIO pin, like GPIO5) to the AD9850’s reset pin. This lets the Pico 2 restart or reset the AD9850 if needed, ensuring the signal generator starts cleanly. 5.	The Overall Current Flow: o	Current starts at the AD9850, goes out as a square wave into the RLC circuit, and then returns to the common ground. o	While the current is flowing through the RLC circuit, touching the sensor changes how easily the current flows (by changing the capacitance), which changes the voltage that the Pico 2 sees.
